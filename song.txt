Coming out to the light of day
We got...many moons that are deep at place
So I...keep an eye on the shadow's smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Spinnin' knot that is on my heart
It's like a...bit of light and a touch of dark
You got...sneak attack from the Zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Keep the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?
